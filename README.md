Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning


Summary :

This dataset consists of 200 male and female annual income and spending score. The dataset is collected from kaggle. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset. We will be using clustering algorithm to find out interesting patterns for different sets of data grouped together in clusters.This data set is created only for the learning purpose of the customer segmentation concepts , also known as market basket analysis . I will demonstrate this by using unsupervised ML technique (KMeans Clustering Algorithm) in the simplest form.


Objective :

You own the mall and want to understand the customers like who can be easily converge [Target Customers] so that the sense can be given to marketing team and plan the strategy accordingly.


Inference :
We observe that Annual Income vs Spending plot gives the best representation of the clusters formed.
The green group includes the customers who although having lower Income tend to spend high percentage of it.
Customers belonging to the red ,violet and orange tend to follow a linear relationship between Annual Income and Spend which is what we usually expect.
